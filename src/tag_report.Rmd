In attempt to converge ideas from **T**echnology, **E**ntertainment and **D**esign, non-profit organization [TED](https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization) was formed. TED aims to make great ideas accessible. But what kind of ideas are they spreading? 

<br/>
In this simple analysis project I have explored how the topic of TED talks have changed over time. The  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks) used contains information on all 2550 TED-talks given up until September 21st, 2017. Each talk is given a list of tags to describe the theme of the talk (eg. "technology", "sustainability", "education", etc.). By identifying the frequency that each of these tags appears per annum we can see how the popularity of each tag changes over time. 

<br/>
## The data 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
```

Below is a preview of the raw data. 
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
head_data <- head(read_csv("data/ted_talks.csv")) %>% select (main_speaker, film_date, tags)
kable(head_data, caption = "raw data")
```

The orginal dataset contains a lot of data irrelevant to this analysis. For example, things like the number of comments on the video or the list of languages it has been translated into. For this reason, I have only imported the main speaker of each talk, the film date and the associated tags. 

<br/>
## The analysis

As shown above, the film-date for each talk is recoreded as UNIX timestamp. Before performing any analysis the script `src/clean_data.R` cleans the data such that all filmdates are recorded as POSIX date-times. Following this, the script `src/find_tags.R` is used to find the tally of each tag per year. Tallys have been represented as a frequency proportional to the number of talks given that year. Note that the proportions will not sum to 100% as each talk can have more than one tag. Below is a preview of the most popular tags in 2016.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
sum_table <- read_csv("results/tag_tallys.csv") %>% filter(year == 2016) %>% head(5)

kable(sum_table, caption = "tag-tally summary, 2016")
```

<br/>
## Results 

The following is a visualization of the 10 most popular tags in 2016, 2011, 2016 compared to the top 10 tags over all-time.
