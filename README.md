# TED-tags


Demonstrates an automated analysis pipeline.    

----
<br/>
How have the topics of TED-talks changed over time? 

<br/> 

Using a dataset obtained from kaggle, this project investigates what most TED-talks are about in a given year. Each talk is marked with a series of tags that form a brief summary of its theme. By analyzing the themes on a yearly basis we can visualize what most talks that year were about. 
 
<br/>    

Raw data can be found in the `data` directory. A summarized report can be found in the `doc` directory.
