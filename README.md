How have the topics of TED-talks changed over time? Using a dataset obtained from 
[kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks) , this project investigates what most TED-talks are about in a given year. Each talk is marked with a series of tags that form a brief summary of its theme. By analyzing the themes on a yearly basis we can visualize what most talks that year were about.  



Raw data can be found in the `data` directory. A summarized report can be found in the `doc` directory.
